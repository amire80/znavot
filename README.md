# znavot
A Python script for searching MediaWiki dumps for link trails

This is a very initial version, which barely works for the Hebrew Wikipedia.

This version is super-bare. I’m just trying to release early and often.
I’ll add running instructions, better error handling, support for other languages
and other much-needed features some time later.
